# help
Ok , basically i followed the tutorial video i commented (https://youtu.be/utL3oW1za_k) , however , while the app is launching and actually resolving a problem i encountered , the application does not "reload" itself . 

i'm using pycharm community on windows , and i launch the app using "set DEBUG=1 ; python main.py" 

i then tried to modify the print instruction in main.py to "hello world" , but no change is made .

I appreciate your help .
